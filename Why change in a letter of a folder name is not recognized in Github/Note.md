When you change **only the case of letters** in a folder or file name (like renaming `Folder` to `folder`), Git might not recognize this change, especially on **case-insensitive file systems** (like **Windows** or **macOS** by default). Here’s why and how to fix it:

---

### **Why This Happens:**

1. **Case-Insensitive File Systems:**
   - On Windows and macOS (unless configured otherwise), the file system treats `Folder` and `folder` as the **same** name. So when you rename it, Git doesn’t detect a difference, because the underlying system doesn’t either.

2. **Git Tracks Content, Not Case Alone:**
   - Git is case-sensitive, but when running on a case-insensitive system, it relies on the file system to detect changes. If the file system says nothing changed, Git follows suit.

### **How to Fix It:**

#### **Method 1: Use `git mv` for Case Changes**

1. **Rename to a temporary name first:**
   ```bash
   git mv Folder temp_folder
   ```
2. **Then rename it to the desired case:**
   ```bash
   git mv temp_folder folder
   ```
3. **Commit the change:**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Renamed 'Folder' to 'folder'"
   ```

#### **Method 2: Configure Git to Track Case Changes**

You can tell Git to recognize case-only changes explicitly:

1. Run this command to configure Git:
   ```bash
   git config core.ignorecase false
   ```

2. Now, rename the folder:
   ```bash
   git mv Folder folder
   ```

3. Commit the change:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Changed folder name case from 'Folder' to 'folder'"
   ```

### **Final Notes:**
- **On GitHub:** Once you push the changes, GitHub (which uses a case-sensitive file system) will recognize and display the case change correctly.
