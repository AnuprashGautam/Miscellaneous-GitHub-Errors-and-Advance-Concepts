## ‚ùå Git Error: Filename too long

### üßæ Error Message

```
error: unable to index file '<very long filepath>'
fatal: unable to index files
```

---

## üìå What Does It Mean?

This error occurs when **the file path exceeds the maximum allowed length on Windows**, which is:

> **260 characters (MAX_PATH limit)**

This includes:
```
Full path = drive letter + folders + filename
```

Example:
```
C:\Users\Anuprash\Documents\...<rest_of_path>...\RestfulWebServicesApplication.java
```

On Windows, Git can fail to **add**, **commit**, or **track** files when their paths are too deep ‚Äî especially common in Java projects with deeply nested packages.

---

## ‚úÖ How to Fix It

### ‚úîÔ∏è 1. Enable Long Paths Support in Git

Run this command **as Administrator**:

```bash
git config --system core.longpaths true
```

üîß This tells Git to allow file paths longer than 260 characters (only works if Windows itself also supports it).

### ‚úîÔ∏è 2. Enable Long Paths in Windows (Optional but Ideal)

If you still face issues, enable long paths at the OS level:

#### üìå Steps:
1. Press `Windows + R`, type `gpedit.msc`, and press Enter.
2. Go to:
   ```
   Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > System > Filesystem
   ```
3. Find **Enable Win32 long paths**
4. Set it to **Enabled**.
5. Reboot your system.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This works only on **Windows 10 version 1607 or newer**.

### ‚úîÔ∏è 3. Rename Folders or Shorten Path (Quick Fix)

If you're not able to change system settings (e.g., on a school or office computer), you can:

- Move the repository closer to the root directory, like:
  ```
  C:\Projects\springboot-rest
  ```
- Rename long folder names to shorter ones, e.g.:
  ```
  restful-web-services ‚Üí restapi
  ```

This reduces the path length and avoids triggering the limit.
